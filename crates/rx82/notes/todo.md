For boot ROM we need:
[ ] ROM: print decimal routine
[X] Asm/CPU: `sub`
[X] ROM: show bytes free message
[ ] CPU: invoke monitor from trap

Use case programs to write:
[ ] 16-bit multiply routine
[ ] Print status flags

For complete emulator we need:
[X] CPU: push / pop `ps` on `trap` / `rti`

Other:
[ ] Monitor: bus tracing
[ ] Monitor: disassembly
[ ] Monitor: assembly
[ ] Monitor: modify memory
[ ] Monitor: command history/editing (`rustyline`)
[X] System: “turbo mode”
[ ] Assembler: define symbols (`=`)
[ ] Assembler: format source file
[ ] Asm: report program size
[ ] Asm: decimal literals
[ ] Assembler: fancy error reporting (`annotate-snippets-rs`)
[ ] Disassembler: SkoolKit-style HTML cross-linked listings
[ ] System: emulated serial device
[ ] ROM: write character to serial
[X] CPU: generate state transition list
